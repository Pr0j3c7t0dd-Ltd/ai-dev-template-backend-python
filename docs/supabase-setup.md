# Supabase Setup and Configuration## OverviewThis project uses Supabase for authentication, database, and storage. Supabase is configured to run either locally for development or remotely for production.## Local Development Setup1. Make sure you have Docker installed and running2. Install the Supabase CLI: `brew install supabase/tap/supabase`3. Start Supabase locally: `supabase start`## Environment VariablesThe following environment variables need to be set for Supabase integration:### Basic Configuration- `SUPABASE_URL`: The URL of your Supabase instance (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:54321` for local or `https://your-project.supabase.co` for production)### Authentication KeysSupabase provides two types of keys:1. **Anon/Public Key**: For client-side operations with limited permissions   - Set as `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`   - Used for authentication operations like signup, login, etc.   - Has restricted access based on Row Level Security (RLS) policies2. **JWT Secret**: Used to verify JWT tokens   - Set as `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`   - Required for token validation## Key Usage Guidelines- **Frontend/Client Requests**: Always use the Anon Key (`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)- **Security Warning**: Never expose the Service Role Key in client-side code or APIs## TroubleshootingIf you encounter database errors during signup:1. Check that Supabase is running: `supabase status`2. Verify your database schema in Supabase Studio: http://localhost:543233. Examine the RLS policies for the auth schema4. Check the logs for specific error messages: `supabase logs`## Updating KeysIf you need to regenerate keys in a production environment, follow these steps:1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard2. Go to Project Settings > API3. Generate new API keys4. Update your environment variables with the new keys5. Restart your server to apply the changes## Resources- [Supabase Documentation](https://supabase.io/docs)- [Supabase CLI Reference](https://supabase.io/docs/reference/cli/introduction)- [Row Level Security](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security)

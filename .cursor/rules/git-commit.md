Rule Name: git-commit-message-best-practices
Description: Enforce best practices for writing git commit messages, inspired by Equal Experts' "Writing commit messages that tell a story".

# Git Commit Message Best Practices

## 1. Tell a Story
- Write commit messages that explain the "why" and "what" of the change, not just the "how".
- Provide context for future readers to understand the reason behind the change.

## 2. Use the Imperative Mood
- Start the subject line with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove").

## 3. Keep Subject Line Concise
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters or less.
- Capitalize the first letter.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.

## 4. Separate Subject from Body
- Leave a blank line between the subject and the body (if a body is needed).

## 5. Provide a Detailed Body (if necessary)
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
- Wrap lines at 72 characters.
- Reference relevant issues, tickets, or context.

## 6. Make Each Commit a Logical Unit
- Each commit should represent a single logical change.
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in one commit.

## 7. Use Consistent Formatting
- Use present tense and imperative mood throughout.
- Example: "Refactor authentication logic to improve clarity."

## 8. Avoid WIP and Non-descriptive Messages
- Do not use "WIP", "fix", "update", or similar vague messages.
- Be specific about what was changed and why.

## 9. Review Before Committing
- Reread your commit message before pushing to ensure clarity and completeness.

## 10. Example of A Good Commit Message
